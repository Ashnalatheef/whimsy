Subject: [project] Board Report due for [month] [year] - Initial Reminder

This email was sent on behalf of the ASF Board.  It is an initial reminder to
give you plenty of time to prepare the report.

According to board records, you are listed as the chair of a committee that is
due to submit a report this month. [1] [2]

The meeting is scheduled for [meetingDate] and the deadline for
submitting your report is 1 full week prior to that ([dueDate])!

Meeting times in other time zones:

  [timeZoneInfo]

Please submit your report with sufficient time to allow the board members
to review and digest. Again, the very latest you should submit your report
is 1 full week (7days) prior to the board meeting ([dueDate]).

If you feel that an error has been made, please consult [1] and if there
is still an issue then contact the board directly.

As always, PMC chairs are welcome to attend the board meeting.

Thanks,
The ASF Board

issues. Line lengths should be limited to 77 characters.  If submitting

Chairs may use the Apache Reporter Service [4] to help them compile and
submit a board report.


Resolutions

There are several templates for use for various Board resolutions.
They can be found in [3] and you are encouraged to use them. It is
strongly recommended that if you have a resolution before the board,
you are encouraged to attend that board meeting.
